# SpaCy_Custom_Spell_NER_Pipeline

This small project is inspired by [Ines Montani's Advanced NLP with spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io/en/chapter4). The purpose of this notebook is to showcase a simple example of training a custom spaCy pipeline, and is purely for educational purpose.
You can find the full text of the book used in the notebook [in this repo](https://github.com/formcept/whiteboard/blob/master/nbviewer/notebooks/data/harrypotter/Book%201%20-%20The%20Philosopher's%20Stone.txt), I do not own the right to distribute it and was using it only as non-commertial educational demonstration.
